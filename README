Xfce4-screenshooter-plugin

	This is a plugin for the Xfce panel to take screenshots, similar to gnome-screenshot. The code is designed to be clean and simple, but improvements, fixes, bug reporting are welcome.

	Since version 1.0.0 the plugin is compatible with xfce4-panel >= 4.3-svn, with several improvements. Thanks to Jani Monoses who ported the plugin to the new structure and added new features.
