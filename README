Screenshot XFce4 panel plugin.

	A xfce-panel plugin to take screenshots, it's copy^^^similar of gnome-screenshot
for gnome. I try to maintain a clean code an simple. But improvementns, corrections,
bug reporting, are welcome.

	Since version 1.0.0 the plugin it's compatible with xfce4-panel >= 4.3-svn, with several
improvements. Thanks to Jani Monoses who ported the plugin to the new structure and 
added new features.
