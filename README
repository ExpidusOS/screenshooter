This application allows you to capture the entire screen, the active 
window or a selected region. You can set the delay that elapses 
before the screenshot is taken and the action that will be done with 
the screenshot: save it to a PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, or 
open it using another application.

A plugin for the Xfce panel is also available.
