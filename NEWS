=== Version 1.4.90 ===

  The application is now named "Xfce4 Screenshooter", the adress of the
  SVN trunk has changed and the one of the website too. See the README
  file. xfce4-panel dependency has been bumped to >= 4.4.

  * Bugfixes:
    - correctly grab active windows. In particular, menus are grabbed
      now (bug #4611).
    - correctly save the preferences, even if ~/.config/xfce4 does
      not exist. Thanks to Nick Schermer for the explanations.
    - when saving the screenshot fails, show an error dialog
      explaning why it failed.
    - fix some remaining crashes when taking a screenshot of the active
      window.
    - only read the preferences file once when opening the application.
    - don't automatically set filenames in the file chooser, as user set
      ones are overriden (bug #4748).

  * Enhancements:
    - Use -V for the version CLI option.
    - Add possibility to copy the screenshot to the clipboard, thanks to
      David Collins.
    - Add possibility to define region to be captured using the mouse,
      thanks to David Collins.
    - Add CLI options for the region selection and to open the
      screenshot with an application.
    - The dialog for the plugin preferences and the application has been
      totally rewritten to improve the user interface: it should look
      cleaner and tooltips have been added. Work started by David
      Collins.
    - When using delay, detect the area to screenshot after the delay,
      and not before, as it caused weird results in some cases.
    - Add a documentation accessible from the application and the panel
      plugin.
