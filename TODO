Long term:

* Port "select a region" to use caiiro to have transparent rubber banding
as in thunar and xfdesktop.
* Use Xshape to have a transparent background in the generated screenshots.

Before next release:

* the Zimagez code needs a lot of error checking.
* Fix last user.
* Improve the results dialog with a text area and URL in tooltips.
* Add a pulsy progress bar for the zimagez upload.
* Make the zimagez stuff optionnal.
* Update the documentation.
* Check for leaks.

Low priority:
* Try to get borders captured with compiz.
* Consider porting the code to use GObjects instead of structs.
