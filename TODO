Before next release:

* Port "select a region" to use cairo to have transparent rubber banding
as in thunar and xfdesktop (only when the screen is composited).

Long term:
* Use Xshape to have a transparent background in the generated screenshots.

Low priority:

* Try to get borders captured with compiz.
* Consider porting the code to use GObjects instead of structs.
