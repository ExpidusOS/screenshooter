* Port "select a region" to use cairo to have transparent rubber banding
as in thunar and xfdesktop.
* Check for leaks using valgrind.
* Use Xshape to have a transparent background in the generated screenshots.
* Remove every call to xfce_err with a gtk_message_dialog.
* the Zimagez code needs a lot of error checking.

Low priority:
* Try to get borders captured with compiz.
* Consider porting the code to use GObjects instead of structs.
