<h1>Help for Xfce4 Screenshooter</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This application allows you to capture the entire
screen, the active window or a selected region. You can set the delay 
that elapses before the screenshot is taken and the action that will be done 
with the screenshot: save it to a PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, 
or open it using another application.</p>

<p>A plugin for the Xfce panel is also available.</p>

<h2>Using the application</h2>

<h3>Via the user interface</h3>

<p>To launch the application, use the <b>"Take a screenshot"</b> item in
the <b>"Accessories"</b> category of Xfce's main menu.</p>

<p>This window will be displayed:</p>

<img src="images/xfce4-screenshooter-dialog.png" alt="The window of the application"/>

<h4>Region to capture</h4>

<p>The <b>"Region to capture"</b> section allows you to set from what the 
screenshot will be taken:

<ul>
  <li>"Entire screen" takes a screenshot of the whole screen as you see it.</li>
  <li>"Active window" takes a screenshot of the active window, the one which was active 
  before this dialog appeared, or if you set a delay, the one that is
  active after the delay.</li>
  <li>"Select a region" allows you to select a region to be captured by 
  clicking a point of the screen without releasing the mouse button, 
  dragging your mouse to the other corner of the region, and releasing 
  the mouse button.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Delay before taking the screenshot</h4>

<p>The <b>"Delay before taking the screenshot"</b> section allows you to
set the delay that will elapse between pressing the <b>Take the screenshot</b>
button and taking the screenshot. This delay will allow you to open menus or
to do whatever action you want to see displayed on the screenshot.</p>

<h4>Action</h4>

<p>The <b>"Action"</b> section allows you to choose what should be done
with the screenshot. Three choices are available.</p>

<h5>Save</h5>

<p>The <b>"Save"</b> option will save the screenshot to a PNG file.
If you check the <b>"Save by default to"</b> checkbox, the screenshot will
be saved to the folder on the right after you press the <b>"Take the screenshot"</b> 
button, without showing any save dialog. Otherwise, a save dialog will be 
displayed, which also shows a preview of the screenshot. You will then be 
able to set the save location, and the name of the file.
</p>

<h5>Copy to the clipboard</h5>

<p>The <b>"Copy to the clipboard"</b> option allows you to paste the screenshot
in another application, such as a word processor. Exiting the application
before the screenshot is pasted often removes the image from the clipboard. 
Some clipboard managers allow you to prevent this.</p>

<h6>Open with</h6>

<p>The <b>"Open with"</b> option saves the screenshot to the system's temporary
directory and opens it with the application set using the dropdown list below.
Applications which support images are automatically detected and added
to the dropdown list.
</p>

<h3>Via command line</h3>

<p>Command line options allow you to take screenshots quickly. They also allow
you to configure the Prt Scrn key on the upper right of most keyboards so that
it takes screenshots. To do so, configure the keybindings of your desktop
environnement so that it launches <b>xfce4-screenshooter</b> with one or
several of the following options when the Prt Scrn key is pressed.</p>

<h4>The command line options</h4>

<h5>The -w option</h5>

<p>The <b>-w</b> option allows you to take a screenshot of the active window.</p>

<h5>The -f option</h5>

<p>The <b>-f</b> option allows you to take a screenshot of the entire screen.</p>

<h5>The -r option</h5>

<p>The <b>-r</b> option allows you to select a region to be captured 
by clicking a point of the screen without releasing the mouse button, 
dragging your mouse to the other corner of the region, and releasing 
the mouse button.</p>

<h5>The -d option</h5>

<p>The <b>-d</b> option followed by a positive integer allows you to set 
the delay before taking the screenshot when the <b>-f</b>, the <b>-w</b>  
or the <b>-r</b> option is given.</p>

<h5>The -s option</h5>

<p>The <b>-s</b> option followed by the path to an existing folder allows you
to set where the screenshots are saved. It only has an effect if the
<b>-f</b>, the <b>-w</b> or the <b>-r</b> option is given. Combined with the 
<b>-h option</b> (see below), it can be used to save a file to a given 
path, without showing any save dialog.</p>

<h5>The -h option</h5>

<p>If you give the <b>-h</b> option, the screenshot will be saved without
showing any save dialog. It only has an effect if the
<b>-f</b>, the <b>-w</b> or the <b>-r</b> option is given. The <b>-s</b> 
option allows you to set the save location if needed.</p>

<h5>The -o option</h5>

<p>If the <b>-o</b> option is given, the screenshot will be saved to the
system's temporary directory and opened with the application whose
name is to be given after -o. It only has an effect if the <b>-f</b>,
 the <b>-w</b> or the <b>-r</b> option is given.</p>
