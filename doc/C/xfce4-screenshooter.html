<h1>Help for the Xfce screenshot tool</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This application allows you to take screenshots of the entire
screen or of the active window. You can set the delay that elapses before 
the screenshot is taken and the action that will be done with the
screenshot: save it to a PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, or open
it using another application.</p>

<p>A plugin for the Xfce panel is also available.</p>

<h2>Using the application</h2>

<h3>Via the user interface</h3>

<p>To launch the application, use the <b>"Take a screenshot"</b> item in
the <b>"Accessories"</b> category of Xfce's main menu.</p>

<p>This window will be displayed:</p>

<img src="images/xfce4-screenshooter-dialog.png" alt="The window of the application"/>

<h4>Area to capture</h4>

<p>The <b>"Area to screenshot"</b> section allows you to set what will be
screenshoted:

<ul>
  <li>"Entire screen" takes a screenshot of screen as you see it, in its
  totality.</li>
  <li>"Active window" takes a screenshot of the active window, that is
  to say the one which was active before this dialog appeared.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Delay before taking the screenshot</h4>

<p>The <b>"Delay before taking the screenshot"</b> section allows you to
set the delay that will elapse between pressing the <b>Take the screenshot</b>
button and taking the screenshot. This delay will allow you to open menus or
to do whatever action you want to see displayed on the screenshot.</p>

<h4>Action</h4>

<p>The <b>"Action"</b> section allows you to choose what should be done
with the screenshot. Three choices are available.</p>

<h5>Save</h5>

<p>The <b>"Save"</b> option will save the screenshot to a PNG file.
If you check the <b>"Save by default to"</b> checkbox, the screenshot will
be saved after you press the <b>"Take the screenshot"</b> button, without
showing any save dialog. Else, a save dialog will be displayed, also
showing a preview of the screenshot, you will then be able to set the save
location and the name of the file.
</p>

<h5>Copy to the clipboard</h5>

<p>The <b>"Copy to the clipboard"</b> option allows you to paste the screenshot
in another application, such as a word processor.</p>

<h6>Open with</h6>

<p>The <b>"Open with"</b> option saves the screenshot to the system's temporary
directory and opens it with the application set using the dropdown list below.
The applications which support images are automatically detected and added
to the dropdown list.
</p>

<h3>Via command line</h3>

<p>Command line options allow you to take screenshots quickly. They also allow
you to configure the Prt Scrn key on the upper right of most keyboards so that
it takes screenshots. To do so, configure the keybindings of your desktop
environnement so that it launches <b>xfce4-screenshooter</b> with one of
the following options when the Prt Scrn key is pressed.</p>

<h4>The command line options</h4>

<h5>The -w option</h5>

<p>The <b>-w</b> option allows you to take a screenshot of the active window.</p>

<h5>The -f option</h5>

<p>The <b>-f</b> option allows you to take a screenshot of the entire screen.</p>

<h5>The -d option</h5>

<p>The <b>-d</b> option followed by a positive integer allows you to set 
the delay before taking the screenshot when the <b>-f</b> or <b>-w</b> option
is given.</p>

<h5>The-s option</h5>

<p>The <b>-s</b> option followed by the path to an existing folder allows you
to set where the screenshots are saved. It only has an effect if the
<b>-f</b> or the <b>-w</b> option is given. It has an effect on the
<b>-h option</b>, see below.</p>

<h5>The -h option</h5>

<p>If you give the <b>-h</b> option, the screenshot will be saved without
showing any save dialog. If the <b>-s</b> option is given, it will be saved
to this directory.</p>
